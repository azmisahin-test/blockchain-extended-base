# blockchain-extended-base
Comprehensive blockchain project covering consensus algorithms, computations, smart contracts, dApps, and decentralized storage.

A comprehensive blockchain project covering:

- Consensus algorithms
- Computations
- Smart contracts (e.g., ERC20, ERC721)
- Decentralized applications (dApps)
- Distributed storage (IPFS, LevelDB)

This project is designed to provide a flexible and modular foundation for blockchain-related development.

## Project Structure

- `computations_algorithms/` - Contains hashing, encryption, and computation functions.
- `consensus_algorithms/` - Different consensus algorithms (PoW, PoS, PoA, etc.).
- `blockchain/` - Core blockchain logic (block creation, validation, etc.).
- `logic/` - Main logic of the blockchain, transaction handling.
- `networking/` - P2P communication, node synchronization.
- `storage/` - Distributed and local storage (IPFS, LevelDB).
- `smart_contracts/` - Smart contracts for tokens and other features.
- `cryptocurrencies/` - Token standards (ERC-20, ERC-721).
- `dapps/` - Frontend and backend for decentralized applications.

## Installation
